=== Concepts

[[dashboard:GitDuplicateAuthors]]
[source,cypher,role=concept]
.Remove duplicate `:Git:Author` commits identified by their `name`.
----
MATCH
  (a:Author)
WITH
  a.name as name, collect(a) as authors
WITH
  head(authors) as author, tail(authors) as duplicates
UNWIND
  duplicates as duplicate
MATCH
  (duplicate)-[:COMMITTED]->(c:Commit)
MERGE
  (author)-[:COMMITTED]->(c)
DETACH DELETE
  duplicate
RETURN
  author.name as Author, count(duplicate) as NumberOfDuplicates
ORDER BY
  NumberOfDuplicates desc
----

[[dashboard:GitMergeCommit]]
[source,cypher,role="concept"]
.Every `:Git:Commit` with more than one parent commit is labeled as `Merge`.
----
MATCH
  (c:Commit)-[:HAS_PARENT]->(p:Commit)
WITH
  c, count(p) as parents
WHERE
  parents > 1
SET
  c:Merge
RETURN
  count(c) as MergeCommits
----

[[dashboard:GitTimeTree]]
[source,cypher,role="concept"]
.Each `:Commit` is assigned to a time tree `(:Commit)-[:OF_DAY]->(:Day)-[:OF_MONTH]-(:Month)-[:OF_YEAR]->(:Year)` according the the commit `date`.
----
MATCH
  (c:Commit)
WITH
  c, split(c.date, "-") as parts 
MERGE
  (y:Year{year:parts[0]})
MERGE
  (m:Month{month:parts[1]})-[:OF_YEAR]->(y)
MERGE
  (d:Day{day:parts[2]})-[:OF_MONTH]->(m)
MERGE
  (c)-[:OF_DAY]->(d)
RETURN
  y.year as Year, count(c) as Commits
ORDER BY
  Year
----

[[dashboard:GitFileName]]
[source,cypher,role="concept",verify="aggregation"]
.Copies the relativePath property of `:Git:File` nodes to the property `fileName` that is index and allows faster lookups.
----
MATCH
  (f:Git:File)
SET
  f.fileName = f.relativePath
RETURN
  count(f) as Files
----

[[dashboard:TypeHasSourceGitFile]]
[source,cypher,role="concept",requiresConcepts="dashboard:GitFileName"]
.A `HAS_SOURCE` relationship is created between a `:Java:Type` and a `:Git:File` if their source file names match.
----
MATCH
  (p:Java:Package)-[:CONTAINS]->(t:Java:Type)
WITH
  t, p.fileName + "/" + t.sourceFileName as sourceFileName // e.g. "/org/junit/Test.java"
MATCH
  (f:Git:File)
WHERE
  f.fileName ends with sourceFileName
MERGE
  (t)-[h:HAS_SOURCE]->(f)
RETURN
  count(h) as Matches
----

[[dashboard:Filetype]]
[source,cypher,role="concept"]
.A property `fileType` is added to each `:Git:File` extracted from extension of the `relativePath`.(e.g. java).
----
MATCH
  (f:Git:File)
WITH
  f, split(f.relativePath, "/") as splittedPathName
WITH
  f, splittedPathName[size(splittedPathName)-1] as fileName
WHERE
  fileName contains "."
WITH
  f, split(fileName, ".") as splittedFileName
SET
  f.type = splittedFileName[size(splittedFileName)-1]
RETURN
  f.type as FileType, count(f) as FilesOfType
ORDER BY
  FilesOfType desc
